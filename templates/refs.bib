  abstract = {In the era of big data, deep learning for predicting stock market prices and trends has become even more popular than before. We collected 2 years of data from Chinese stock market and proposed a comprehensive customization of feature engineering and deep learning-based model for predicting price trend of stock markets. The proposed solution is comprehensive as it includes pre-processing of the stock market dataset, utilization of multiple feature engineering techniques, combined with a customized deep learning based system for stock market price trend prediction. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on frequently used machine learning models and conclude that our proposed solution outperforms due to the comprehensive feature engineering that we built. The system achieves overall high accuracy for stock market trend prediction. With the detailed design and evaluation of prediction term lengths, feature engineering, and data pre-processing methods, this work contributes to the stock analysis research community both in the financial and technical domains.},

  abstract = {In today's society, investment wealth management has become a mainstream of the contemporary era. Investment wealth management refers to the use of funds by investors to arrange funds reasonably, for example, savings, bank financial products, bonds, stocks, commodity spots, real estate, gold, art, and many others. Wealth management tools manage and assign families, individuals, enterprises, and institutions to achieve the purpose of increasing and maintaining value to accelerate asset growth. Among them, in investment and financial management, people's favorite product of investment often stocks, because the stock market has great advantages and charm, especially compared with other investment methods. More and more scholars have developed methods of prediction from multiple angles for the stock market. According to the feature of financial time series and the task of price prediction, this article proposes a new framework structure to achieve a more accurate prediction of the stock price, which combines Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Long--Short-Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM). This new method is aptly named stock sequence array convolutional LSTM (SACLSTM). It constructs a sequence array of historical data and its leading indicators (options and futures), and uses the array as the input image of the CNN framework, and extracts certain feature vectors through the convolutional layer and the layer of pooling, and as the input vector of LSTM, and takes ten stocks in U.S.A and Taiwan as the experimental data. Compared with previous methods, the prediction performance of the proposed algorithm in this article leads to better results when compared directly.},

  abstract  = { Forecasting a stock price movement is one of the most difficult problems in finance. The reason is that financial time series are complex, non stationary. Furthermore, it is also very difficult to predict this movement with parametric models. Instead of parametric models, we propose two techniques, which are data driven and non parametric. Based on the idea that excess returns would be possible with publicly available information, we developed two models in order to forecast the short term price movements by using technical indicators. Our assumption is that the future value of a stock price depends on the financial indicators although there is no parametric model to explain this relationship. This relationship comes from the technical analysis. Comparison shows that support vector regression (SVR) out performs the multi layer perceptron (MLP) networks for a short term prediction in terms of the mean square error. If the risk premium is used as a comparison criterion, then the SVR technique is as good as the MLP method or better. }

abstract = {Individual stock trend prediction is extremely valuable for investment management. Previous studies mainly focused on proposing effective approaches to make profits. However, there is an ineffectiveness in model evaluation due to the inconsistency between model’s performance and profitability. We name this inconsistency profit bias. In order to address the profit bias in model evaluation, this paper proposes a new effective metric, Mean Profit Rate (MPR). The effectiveness of metric is measured based on the correlation between the metric value and profit of the model. Experiments on five stock daily index data among four countries show that MPR outperforms the classification metrics in correlating to profit. In view of these findings, we suggest that MPR is a more effective metric than the classification metrics in stock trend prediction.}

Methodically, the CNN-LSTM neural network is used to make the quantitative stock selection strategy for judging stock trends by using the CNN, and then make the quantitative timing strategy for improving the profits by using the LSTM. It is demonstrated by the experiments that the CNN-LSTM neural network model can be successfully applied to making quantitative strategy, and achieving better returns than the basic Momentum strategy and the Benchmark index.",
